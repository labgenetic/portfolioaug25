            I’m a 23-year-old self-taught 
Moroccan designer with real-world project experience.

My design journey started in 2023 at Ark-X Academy while training as a Fullstack Web Dev—where I discovered my passion for visual storytelling.

But design kept pulling me back. Every job demanded 
creativity, from crafting SVG icons to designing full websites.

So here I am—a developer by training, a designer at heart.
